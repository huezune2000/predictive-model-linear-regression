# Predictive Model using Linear Regression

# Description:
### More often than not, resources are scarce for businesses. It is essential to have the meaningful information to make the right decision and craft an effective strategy. Having a deeper understanding of the data can benefit businesses to for informed decision-making. In this dataset "ecommerce customers", the business question to be answered is whether more resources to be invested on their website or online app. The machine learning linear regression model will be used to answer the busines question.


# Project Objective:
### To determine if investing in website or online app have more positive impact to the business' profitability. The target feature or y-variable is "Yearly Amount Spent".

# Process:
### This interesting project will start off with basic descriptive analysis, followed by detailed exploratory data analysis, data visualization of the features, data cleansing, and scaling the data to prepare for machine learning model from sklearn library. The model will be visualized and evaluated using metrics, such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The project will be concluded with an answer to the business question.

# Positive Impact:
### The business will gain actionable insights to their question, if investing more in the website or app will have significant financial impact. Having a deeper understanding of the data using advanced data analysis can help businesses make the best available decision and deploy an effective business strategies
